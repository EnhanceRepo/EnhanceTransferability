# Enhancing Transferability of Adversarial Attacks for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Systems
This repository contains experiments conducted in the submission "Enhancing Transferability of Adversarial Attacks for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Systems"

**Abstract:**

# Requirements
1. Python 3.9
2. numpy 1.26.4
3. tqdm 4.64.1
4. Torch 1.12.1
5. Torchvision 0.13.1
6. Scipy 1.10.1

# Demo
For example, to run the resizing transformation on udacity datast with adversarial perturbations crafted on the model Dave2V1. The user can run:
```
cd clean
python3 input_resizing_udacity.py --model 'dave2v1'
```

Runtime results for Dave dataset:
